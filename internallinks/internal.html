    <h3 id="web">Introduction to Web</h3>
    <div>The web, short for the World Wide Web, is a vast and interconnected network of information that enables people to access and share data globally through the internet. It is built upon a system of web pages that are interlinked using hyperlinks and accessed via web browsers. The web has revolutionized how we communicate, learn, and conduct business by providing a platform for instant access to a wealth of resources, from educational content to e-commerce. At its core, the web operates using protocols like HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) and is supported by languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These technologies work together to create visually appealing, interactive, and user-friendly websites that cater to diverse needs, making the web an integral part of modern life.

    <h3 id="client">Client-Server</h3>
    <div>The client-server architecture is a foundational model in computer networks that defines how devices interact within a network. In this model, two main components work together: the client and the server.

        Client: A client is a device or application that requests services or resources. Examples include web browsers, mobile apps, and desktop applications. Clients send requests to the server for data or functionality, such as accessing a website or retrieving information from a database.
        
        Server: A server is a powerful computer or software that provides services or resources to clients. It processes client requests and sends back the requested data or performs the requested actions. Servers can host websites, manage databases, or run applications.</div>
  <h3 id="component">Components to Web</h3>
  <div>The web is a complex ecosystem built on various components that work together to enable seamless access to information and services. These components can be broadly categorized as follows:

    Web Clients
    
    Web clients are devices or applications, such as web browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari), used by users to access and interact with web content.
    They send requests to web servers and render the received content for users to view and interact with.
    Web Servers
    
    Web servers host and manage websites, handling client requests and delivering the corresponding resources.
    Examples include Apache, Nginx, and Microsoft IIS.</div>
    <h3 id="overview">Overview of HTTP</h3>
    <div>Stateless Protocol

        HTTP is stateless, meaning each request-response cycle is independent. The server does not retain any information about previous interactions unless explicitly managed using mechanisms like cookies or sessions.
        Client-Server Model
        
        HTTP follows a client-server architecture where the client sends a request, and the server processes it to return a response.
        Text-Based Protocol
        
        HTTP messages are human-readable text consisting of requests (from the client) and responses (from the server).
        Resource-Based
        
        
        HTTP operates on resources identified by URLs (Uniform Resource Locators). These resources can be web pages, images, videos, or other files.</div>
    <h3 id="Gen">Generation of Dynamic webpages</h3>
    <div>Dynamic webpages are interactive and responsive web pages whose content changes based on user interactions, server data, or other real-time factors. Unlike static webpages, which display fixed content, dynamic webpages are generated on-the-fly, offering a personalized experience for users.
